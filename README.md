1. Write a program to accept an integer N and calculate the sum of its digits. Please note N can have maximum 5 digits.
2] Write a program to accept an integer N and generate an integer M which is formed by reversing the digits of N. Please note N can have maximum 5 digit
3] Write a program to accept an integer N and generate an integer M which is formed by reversing the digits of N. Please note N can have maximum 5 digits. Print the numbers N and M. Compare N with M and print the result.
4] Write a program to accept 5 digit integer N and calculate the sum of its first and fifth digit.
5] Write a program to accept a 5 digit integer N and then generates a number M by adding 1 to each digit.
6] Accept cost price(CP) and Selling price(SP) of an item. Calculate the ammount of PROFIT/LOSS made by the seller and print
7] Write a program to a accept a list of N integers. Find the largest and the smallest number in the list and their respective positions in the list.
8] Write a program to accept a list of N integers. Accept integer K. Find the Kth smallest number in the list and its position.
9] Write a program to accept a list L1 of N integers. Accept integer M. Multiply each integer in the list by M and generate a new list L2. Print the lists L1 and L2.
10] Write a program to accept a list L1 of N integers. Accept integer D. Generate list L2 such that it contains only those integers from list L1 which are divisible by D. Calculate the size of list L2. Print the list L1, N, D, list L2 and its size.
11] Write a program to accept cardinality of set A as N, and cardinality of set B as M. Then accept elements of set A and set B. Generate set C which is union of set A and set B, set D which is intersection set of set A and Set B. Print set A, B, C, D, Cardinality of set C, Cardinality of set D.
12] Write a program to accept number of circles N and radius and coordinates of center (x,y) for each circle. Select appropriate data structure and explain why you chose it. Arrange the circles in increasing order of their area and print all the data of each circle.
